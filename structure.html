                One incident happened there in the beach, me and my sister forgot the location of our chair were we kept our shoes and left that place bare footed.<br> Me with my sister after one hour or two went to that place again and found our shoes at the same place we left!No one touched them or any other thing never went lost if someone left anything.<br> There were many kids in the beach but no one begs rather they sell something to everyone, This was impressive.<br> I loved that place and want to visit their soon with my friend and family.<button>read more</button>

            <div class="blog">
            <p>
                South Asian country Bangladesh is blessed with natural beauty and can also be a great destination for traveling.<br> There are some hilly areas here under the Chittagong Hill Tracts and Bandarban is one of them, others are Rangamati and Khagrachari.<br> Last year (Aug 15, 2014 Aug 19, 2014) during Rainy Season it was a great pleasure to travel to some truly attractive destinations with my friend.<br> We did visit Kaptai, Rangamati, and Bandarban and frankly speaking without visiting those places it will be totally unknown to me that my own country is such beauty in a true sense.<br> So how was my Bandarban tour? Explore details inside.

            <h3>My tanguar haowr tour</h3>
            </span>
            <div class="blog">
            <p>
                Travelling to Tanguar Haor and staying in the haor area itself makes one encounter the essence of Bangladesh: <br>the living together with the forces of the water that creates all life in Bangladesh and at the same time is a destructive force.<br> The haor area gets flooded every year during the rainy season.<br> The area is one enormous lake then (from April to October).<br> When the water retreats the remaining lakes constitute a resting place for 100.000 of migratory birds (November-February)<br>You can visit Tanguar Haor in both seaons for a completely different experience.<br>Visits should be made by boat. A one day trip is the minimum but longer trips are possible as boats can provide food and lodging.
